I just wanted to write down a few thoughts that popped into my head.

1 - Normally I prefer to write a seperate front-end rather than do server-side rendering.
 But since the application is so basic, will probably only be used by one or a few people,
  and had "keep it simple" in the requirements, I decided that it would be overkill.
  Also, this will give me a good excuse to learn more about how server-side rendering works
  in the context of TypeScript rather than JavaScript (which I have more experience with).

2- Normally I would always do some sort of authentification when dealing with sensitive data,
but after reading the assignment, I get the idea that it would be beyond the scope of what you
want to see here and that I should just keep it simple.

Things that I would do if I had more time (I have already passed the time limit and working on
it longer would seem unfair)

1- Clean up code / write better TypeScript

2- Write a more efficient way to generate multiple reports (reusing data instead of repeating calculations for each report)

3- See if there is a more elegant/efficient way to get the data I want (maybe using different data structures or functions)

4- Tests

5- Handle edge cases (what if there arent even 5 contacted listings in a month?)

6- Data validation when a new file is uploaded

7- Split my routes up more logically
